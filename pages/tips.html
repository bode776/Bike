                        <strong>1. Protect your head.</strong> Head injuries are
                        the cause of 60 percent of all cycling deaths in the U.
                        S. every year. Many of these deaths could be avoided if
                        everyone wore a helmet while cycling. Always wear a
                        helmet when riding and make sure your kids do as well.
                        Many states have bike helmet laws, but you should always
                        wear one even if you don't have too.
                    </p>

                        >
                        You want to try and keep your cadence between 70 and 90
                        rpm's. When you pedal in a high gear it puts added
                        strain on you knees.

                        <strong>3. Use your gears.</strong> When climbing hills
                        shift into a gear that will keep your cadence in the
                        right range of rpm's so you can make it up the hill
                        without putting undue stress on your knees.

                        <strong>4. Get a proper bike fit.</strong> Having your
                        bike set up to fit your body will make riding much
                        easier, more efficient and cause you much less pain and
                        soreness during and after the ride.

                        <strong>5. Get the right saddle.</strong> Getting the
                        right saddle will make a huge difference when riding.
                        Don't think the thickest padding will give you the most
                        comfortable ride. A longer seat with a cutout will
                        generally be the best type of saddle. Read reviews
                        online and find out what others like, then test ride a
                        few.

                    <p>
                        <strong>6. Change position while riding.</strong> WMove
                        your hands around on the bars, and move your rear end
                        around on the saddle. This will keep your hands, arms
                        and rear from getting numb due to prolonged time in a
                        given position.

                    <p>
                        <strong>7. Don't ride with headphones on.</strong> W It
                        can be extremely dangerous if you don't hear an
                        emergency vehicle or other commotions behind you or off
                        to the side. If you have to have music, get a small
                        clip-on radio with a speaker that you can attach to your
                        jersey.

                    <p>
                        <strong>8. Know the rules.</strong> Ride with traffic
                        and obey all road signs. Closely watch all cars in front
                        of you so you can try to anticipate what they are going
                        to do.

                    <p>
                        <strong>9. Keep your head up.</strong> Look out in front
                        far enough ahead so you can react to any obstacles in
                        the road or on the shoulder in front of you. Things like
                        storm drain grates are very bad for skinny road bike
                        tires.
